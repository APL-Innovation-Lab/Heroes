# Heroes 

"Heroes" are dynamic, full-width images featured prominently on the Austin Public Library website. These visuals serve to spotlight key events, services, or announcements, equipped with text overlays to provide context or call-to-action messages.

## Drupal View Configuration

Create or modify a Drupal View to manage the Heroes slideshow. This setup involves selecting the appropriate content type, incorporating fields for the image and associated text, and defining how these elements are displayed.

## Slideshow Setup

Configure the slideshow within the Drupal View, choosing a suitable plugin or module for slideshow functionality. Adjust settings for transitions, auto-play features, and slide durations to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Image and Text Box Overlay

### Image Preparation
- Ensure images meet the recommended dimensions for full-width display without compromising quality.

### Text Overlay
- Position a text box overlay on each Hero image for additional information. Customize the overlay's appearance, including size, text format, and alignment, to maintain consistency and readability.

## Location-Based Display

The display of Heroes can be tailored to various sections of the site through the "Locations" field within each Hero's configuration. This field allows for selection of one or more predefined zones, determining where the Hero will be shown:

- **All (except AHC):** Makes the Hero visible across all site sections, excluding the Austin History Center (AHC).
- **AHC:** Targets the Hero specifically to the Austin History Center section.
- **Digital Resources:** Displays the Hero within the Digital Resources section.
- **Meeting Rooms:** Assigns the Hero to the Meeting Rooms section.
- **SLR:** Designates the Hero for display in the SLR (Special Local Regulations?) area.
- **Spanish:** Ensures the Hero appears in sections of the site tailored to Spanish-speaking users.
- **Youth:** Directs the Hero to youth-oriented sections of the site.
